Welcome to our **Hacktoberfest 2024** project repository dedicated to exploring **Rust**, the blazing-fast, memory-efficient language with a strong focus on safety. Whether you're new to Rust or an experienced developer, this repository is a great place to contribute, learn, and collaborate!

## ðŸ“š Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of useful utilities, libraries, and mini-projects written in **Rust**. Our goal is to create a shared resource that helps developers get started with Rust and implement common utilities used in day-to-day coding.

The utilities include:
- Data structures
- File I/O
- Error handling
- Concurrency and parallelism
- Network utilities
- Algorithms and more!

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have **Rust** installed. If you don't already have Rust installed, you can follow the official instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
